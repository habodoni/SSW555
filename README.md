# Space Exploration Game

## Overview
The Space Exploration Game is an educational simulation designed to teach K-12 students about astronaut teamwork, resource management, and space survival. Players will complete missions, manage oxygen and resources, repair spaceship malfunctions, and navigate space hazards while learning real-world space principles.

The game is developed using Godot 4.3 with GDScript and follows an Agile development approach, utilizing Jira for task tracking and GitHub for version control.

## Features
- Astronaut character system with movement and resource tracking
- Real-time diagnostics system for spaceship maintenance
- Resource management including oxygen, food, and energy
- Navigation and planetary exploration mechanics
- Educational elements integrated into gameplay
- Unit testing for stability of core mechanics
